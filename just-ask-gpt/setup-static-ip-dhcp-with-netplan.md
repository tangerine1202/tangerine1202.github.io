In short, modifying the config in `/etc/netplan` and then `sudo netplan apply` to apply it. This can be used to configure the static IP or DHCP on ubuntu.

1.  View all network interfaces on the machine

    ```bash
    ip link show
    ```
2. Netplan configuration files
   * Place at `/etc/netplan`
   * Configuration files are merged in lexical order.
   * To ensure the config are not overridden, name it starts with `00-`.
   *   Example: Static ip config

       ```yaml
       # /etc/netplan/00-installer-config.yaml
       network:
         ethernets:
           <interface>:           # shown in ip link, e.g. eth0
             addresses:
             - <ip>/<subnet>      # 192.168.1.100/24
             gateway4: <gateway>  # 192.168.1.254
         version: 2
       ```
   *   Example: DHCP config

       ```yaml
       # /etc/netplan/01-netcfg.yaml
       network:
         ethernets:
           <interface>:
               dhcp4: true
               dhcp6: false
         version: 2
       ```
3.  Apply the new configurations

    ```bash
    sudo netplan apply
    ```
4.  Check the current configuration

    ```bash
    sudo netplan get
    ```
