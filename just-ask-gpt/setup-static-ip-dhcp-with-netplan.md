# Setup Static IP / DHCP with Netplan

> ðŸ’¡ This is one of my quick-reference notes created for personal use and memorization. It includes only minimal explanations to highlight key concepts or procedures.

To configure the static IP or DHCP on Ubuntu, modify the config in `/etc/netplan` and then `sudo netplan apply` to apply it.&#x20;

1.  View all network interfaces on the machine

    ```bash
    ip link show
    ```
2. Netplan configuration files
   * Place at `/etc/netplan`
   * Configuration files are merged in lexical order.
   * To ensure the config are not overridden, name it starts with `00-`.
   *   Example: Static ip config

       ```yaml
       # /etc/netplan/00-installer-config.yaml
       network:
         ethernets:
           <interface>:           # shown in ip link, e.g. eth0
             addresses:
             - <ip>/<subnet>      # 192.168.1.100/24
             gateway4: <gateway>  # 192.168.1.254
         version: 2
       ```
   *   Example: DHCP config

       ```yaml
       # /etc/netplan/01-netcfg.yaml
       network:
         ethernets:
           <interface>:
               dhcp4: true
               dhcp6: false
         version: 2
       ```
3.  Apply the new configurations

    ```bash
    sudo netplan apply
    ```
4.  Check the current configuration

    ```bash
    sudo netplan get
    ```
